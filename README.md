# optibuntu
Slight optimizations to ubuntu (i.e. removing snaps)

You can use a single script or all at once. main.sh calls all the others.
You can add PPAs, apt-packages or flatpaks to be installed by main.sh by adding them line by line to .lst files.

Be sure to run <code>chmod +x *.sh</code> before executing scripts.
